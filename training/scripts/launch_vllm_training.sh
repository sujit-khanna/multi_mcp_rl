# vLLM-Enhanced GRPO Training Launch Script
# =========================================
# 
# This script launches vLLM-enhanced training with 10x+ faster inference
# while maintaining full GRPO training compatibility.
# 
# Key Features:
# - Uses vLLM for fast generation (separate process)
# - Maintains all existing training functionality
# - Safe isolation from existing training scripts
