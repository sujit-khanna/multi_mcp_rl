## Detailed Technical Comparison

### 1. Distributed Computing Strategy

#### SkyRL FlashRL
```python
# Uses Ray for distributed training
@ray.remote
class DAPOTrainer(RayPPOTrainer):
    # Distributed across multiple nodes/GPUs
    # Ray placement groups for resource allocation
    # Hybrid engine configurations
```

#### Our Implementation
```python
# Single-node architecture with threading
class VLLMQwenPolicy:
    # Direct vLLM integration
    # ThreadPoolExecutor for parallelism
    # Memory-optimized for single GPU
```

**Analysis**: SkyRL is built for enterprise-scale distributed training, while ours focuses on research efficiency on limited hardware.

### 2. Algorithm Implementation

#### SkyRL FlashRL - DAPO
- **Algorithm**: DAPO (Distributed Adaptive Policy Optimization)
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic sampling with filtering (`DYNAMIC_SAMPLING_TYPE=filter`)
  - Overlong response punishment mechanism
  - Token-mean loss reduction
  - Clipped probability ratios (0.2-0.28)

#### Our Implementation - GRPO
- **Algorithm**: GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)
- **Key Features**:
  - Real environment rollouts with MCP tools
  - Sample-time logprob preservation
  - Trajectory-based advantage computation
  - LoRA parameter optimization

**Analysis**: Different RL algorithms optimized for different objectives - DAPO for mathematical reasoning, GRPO for tool use.

### 3. Model Architecture & Training

#### SkyRL FlashRL
```bash
# Configuration from run_dapo_flashrl.sh
MODEL="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
DATASET="gsm8k"
NUM_GPUS=2
LOSS_REDUCTION="token_mean"
```

#### Our Implementation
```python
# From training_config_qwen3_0.6b.yaml
model:
  name: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
  use_lora: true
  value_head_hidden_dim: 1024
batch_size: 4
learning_rate: 5e-5
```

**Analysis**: SkyRL uses larger model (1.5B) with full fine-tuning, we use smaller model (0.5B) with LoRA for efficiency.

### 4. vLLM Integration Approach

#### SkyRL FlashRL
```python
class FlashRLVLLMInferenceEngine:
    # Custom vLLM patching before initialization
    # Ray-wrapped inference engines
    # Multiple engine instances
    # Tensor parallelism support
```

#### Our Implementation
```python
class VLLMQwenPolicy:
    # Direct vLLM LLM class usage
    # Single inference engine
    # Custom chat template handling
    # Logprob capture for PPO ratios
```

**Analysis**: SkyRL has enterprise-grade vLLM orchestration, we have research-focused direct integration.

## Conclusion

Both implementations represent valid but different approaches to vLLM-accelerated RL training:
